Just a little program I wrote to generate a Spotify playlist based on user input

The Spotify algorithm is fucked, so hopefully this can do a slightly better job

Instructions are located in the README file inside of the zip


This requires the Spotipy library for Python; pip install spotipy

EDIT: apparently my C key is broken (kinda) so the word "Recommendation" has 2, apologies
